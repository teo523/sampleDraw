# SampleDraw
**SampleDraw** is  a tool that allows the visual manipulation of samples in the time-pitch domain. Firstly, users upload their custom samples to Bela. Then, through Bela GUI, users can draw lines in a time-pitch space, where each line corresponds to a specific sample played back. Samples are manipulated in the time domain for changing their duration and pitch according to the drawn lines. We used a simple method based on circular buffers that allows both time-scale modification and also pitch-scale modification of the samples. The tool allows the simultaneous playing of several samples at the same time, and it allows the user to upload up to four different custom samples.

## HOW TO USE:
First of all, you will need a [Bela](https://bela.io/) device to run the code. 
This folder contains 3 files:

- SampleDraw: the main project code. Upload it directly to Bela by dragging it to the IDE
- Scope: Bela code to use in evaluation purposes. Upload it directly to a second Bela and follow the wiring instructions given in the comments
- Report pdf of the performed work.
