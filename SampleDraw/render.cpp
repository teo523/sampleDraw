/** ECS7012
 * Music and Audio Progrmming
 * Final Project 
 * Teodoro Dannemann
 * 
 * Here we present the code of SampleDraw, a tool that allows the visual manipulation 
 * of samples in the time-pitch domain. Firstly, users upload their custom samples to Bela. Then, through Bela GUI, 
 * users can draw lines in a time-pitch space, where each line corresponds to a specific sample playback. 
 * Samples are manipulated in the time domain for changing their duration and pitch according to the drawn lines. 
 * We used a simple method based on circular buffers that allows both time-scale modification and also pitch-scale 
 * modification of the samples. The tool allows the simultaneous playing of several samples at the same time, and allows 
 * the user to upload up to four different samples.
